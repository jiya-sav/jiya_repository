            "content": "Lab 1: Measurements and Graphical Analysis . Purpose Statement: Given “disks” of different radii, determine the relationship between the mass and radius of the disks through graphical method. In using graphical method, we will learn about linearization and the use of it to create a mathematical model. . Outline of Procedure: . Foil disks of differing sizes are collected. . | The radius of each disk is measured in cm, and multiplied by itself to calculate r2. . | A disk is chosen at random, and folded in half 4 times. The thickness of the folded disk is measured, then divided by 16 to produce the actual thickness of the original disk (unfolded). Each disk has been cut from the same foil sheet, hence the thickness of disks are uniform. . | Each disk is weighed on a scale, and mass is recorded in a data table. . | What is the precision of the meterstick I used? Explain how you know this based on the data I provided. . The precision of the meterstick is to the tenth of a centimeter, in terms of measurement. When my group measured the actual disks, we went one significant figure beyond the shown measurement. . Data Table: . Cylinder Height (cm), Mass (g), and Calculated Radius2 (cm2) Values . . Graphs: . . m = 0.016r^2 - 0.036 . . m = 0.013r^2 + 0.024r - 0.090 . Analysis Questions: . What is the independent variable in your y = mx +b formula? . | The independent variable in our y = 0.016x - 0.036 is x, or radius2 (cm2). . What does the slope represent in your y = mx +b formula? Show dimensionally that indeed that is what your slope represents and that the formula is valid dimensionally. . | The slope is 0.016, which is grams / cm2. The slope is change in mass of cylinder over quantity of change in radius2. . . Should the “b” in your y = mx + b formula be zero? Explain your answer. . | No, the b should not be 0 due to data collection errors. In a perfect world, the line of best fit would go through the origin since if the radius is 0 cm, then radius2 is also 0 cm2, hence the mass would be 0 g. However, due to human error, the data values for radius and mass are not exact, hence the line of best fit that will best represent the data does not go through the origin. A line of best fit should represent all the data points best, not just the origin. . Measure/estimate the “thickness” of your cylinders. Use that value to find the experimental density of your cylinders. Find a percent difference between your found density and the actual density. The actual material is aluminum. . The estimated value for “thickness” is 0.00625 cm. The calculated value of density of the disk is 0.815 g/cm3 (calculations shown below). . | | . The calculated percent difference between actual density (2.7 g/cm3) and calculated density (0.815 g/cm3) is -93%. . | . errors. Make sure you explain why your number is bigger or smaller than (if positive or negative difference.) . Some of the aluminum disks had tiny holes or deficiencies, which likely means that mass measured is inaccurate. The thickness of each disk was extremely small, making it a difficult quantity to measure; hence, there are measurement inaccuracies present due to human error/ limitations. . | | Synthesis Questions: . In this experiment, if we had used disks with greater thickness, would the slope of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be the same? Explain. . If the disks had a greater thickness, then the slope of the best fit line would be different. A greater thickness of the cylinders would result in a higher mass, even if the radius was the same. Hence, the slope of the line of the graph r2, on the x-axis, and mass in g, on the y-axis, would be greater (calculated by taking change in mass over change in r2). . | However, the density would not change. Once the slope of the best fit line is found, it is plugged into the equation slope = (pi)(thickness or height of cylinder)(density). Density is then solved for; the procedure has been demonstrated on analysis question 4. Since the thickness value plugged into this equation is also increased (along with slope), the density value would not be affected. Theoretically, the density value would not change anyway because the material, aluminum, remains the same no matter the thickness of the disk. . | | How would your graph of m vs r2 be different if you had used disks of the same thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m vs r2 plot that represents disks made of steel. . A graph of m vs r2 for disks made out of steel would contain a steeper line of best fit, or one with a higher slope value, than one for disks made of aluminum. This is because disks made of aluminum have a lower density (2.7 g/cm3) than steel (7.85 g/cm3), and working backwards from the slope = (pi)(h of cylinder)(density) equation mentioned in above questions, increasing the density would increase the slope. Since only the density/ material of disks would change, each r2 value would remain the same, while mass would be higher for each steel disk. Hence, the estimated line of best fit for steel disks is steeper by about 7.85/ 2.7 times. . | | . Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; however, their . | disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to determine. The group’s m versus . r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had . the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the density of the unknown material and use the table . below to help determine what material their disks are made of. . The density of the unknown material is about 7.77 g/cm3. Therefore, the material of . | the disks is likely iron. . . Multiple Choice Questions: . . Question 3: The answer is c) r3. Since d = m/v and in this case the volume of spheres are . (4/3)(pi)(r3), the m is linearly proportional to r3. .",

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called.

Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

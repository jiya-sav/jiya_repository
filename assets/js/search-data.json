Program purpose and function | 0 | 0 | The person did not demonstrate or explain “program functionality;” purpose of program is not shown . Same as college board . | . Data abstraction | 1 | 1 | All criterion hit; there are two code segments showing a list called sideIndex with triangle names stored. The if/else statements using that list are also shown. | . Managing complexity | 0 | 0 | There are 4 classifications, but there is no return that fits the requirements. There is no single list that holds all the triangle classifications, so it would be difficult to access and call them when coding. | . Procedural abstraction | 0 | 1 | Yes; this student developed a procedure for ratio calculate. Originally I said that this person did not earn this point since I did not recognize that calculate counted as a procedure. | . Algorithm implementation | 1 | 1 | The student-developed algorithm within procedure, ratio Calculate, includes . sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (for in range loop). They used iterative loops multiple times, which was nice. . | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The response describes the conditions being tested for the two procedure calls. The response . states for the first call that it includes testing and procedures that can be recreated. The responses also states for the second call to check remainders. . | . Submission 2: . Category My Score Actual Score Explanation . Program purpose and function | 1 | 1 | Meets all criteria; program demonstrated and purpose stated. Help button and functionality of life game stated. | . Data abstraction | 1 | 1 | Two distinct code segments are provided. The first segment shows storage of data in a list . named guesses. However, in the second code segment, data stored in the list is not being . used; only the length of the list is accessed. So the response does not meet this criteria. . The name of the list is identified as guesses. . | . Managing complexity | 1 | 1 | The response includes a program code segment that uses a list, but the list is not used to manage complexity. The use of the list is merely to act as a counter, so it can be replaced with . a single counter variable . | . Procedural abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response describes the functionality of the procedure although it misnames the . procedure. . | . Algorithm implementation | 1 | 1 | Clear algorithm developed and explained in game. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | Position input explained; testing procedure explained the changing of colors. | . Creative, Collaborative, and Quality Culture . Express, “What would you code given absolute freedom? . If given absolute freedom, I would want to code something related to helping students access books and learning resources free of charge. Although the legality of this type of code can be debated, I think it would be really cool to be able to create a platform where learning could be shared for the sake of learning and not an ulterior motive (usually profit). I think a platform like this would not only give me a purpose in coding, but would help others. Some technical aspects to the platform could include a voting feature where users could vote for the usefulness of resources, an api for organization purposes, and more. . What would motivate you to be productive each day given the freedom to code what you want? . Generally, when I am unmotivated to code it is because what I am doing does not have an application that is of interest to me. For example, the binary to decimal converter code assignments from the past few weeks were boring. . How would you measure success in your team? . In my opinion, success in my scrum team is based on how collaborative we are. I think that there is more value in learning together than constructing a complex piece of code by ourselves. Success is about building each other up and making sure we all understand basic concepts before moving on to produce amazing work. Even if the work produced is not super complicated, effective learning is what matters. I think that every person has a unique, valuable perspective that should be shared, so “success” in my scrum team to me means that everyone’s perspective is mixed. . In a project, most students are more motivated if the project seems useful, unique, and has an interested consumer. How will you maintain motivation? . I will do my best to maintain my motivation by adding a creative element to the projects I work on. If the work becomes redundant or too heavy on the back end, then I will try to take a break and develop the front end more. I think that although having back and front end code work properly are both satisfying, there is more immediate gratification in having the front end done, because it is more visibly working. . Ending Questions: . Provide summary in comment on why information is this blog is important? . This blog was a reminder on agile methodology and what we can do in our scrum roles to help our teams reach goals. The questions asked here also provided me insight into the benefits of coding and project based learning. I was reminded of what I should be doing while coding, and that I should be working properly with my team and doing my role, and at the same time staying motivated. . Would you rather work on PBL project, or or do assigned free-response coding questions (aka FRQs)? Which would be easier to meet class standards? . I would much rather work on a PBL project, since I would have more freedom to meet class standards and demonstrate my interpretation of the topics. PBL in my opinion also allows students to retain information better, because we can practice the concepts while displaying our creativity instead of just a set format/ rote memorization. . Trust and Freedom are often earned. How will you show your passion and ability to succeed in your work? . I hope to earn trust and freedom in the classroom by showing that I am capable of fulfilling the requirements and taking away the right learnings, while still maintaining independence and personality. I hope that my code will not only include the standards that college board and the teachers desire, but it will also demonstrate my passion and have fun elements. . What key learnings and focusses are a priority for you? . I hope to prioritize becoming proficient in javascript in particular. I think that javascript is a valuable language to know, because it is integral when working on the front end of any project. It doesn’t matter how nice the backend is- if your site doesn’t look professional, then no one will take your work seriously. .",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

            "content": ". . Reflection: Although my logic was correct, I chose the answer choice with the wrong order of code. The actual answer involved appending the list first, which makes sense since the problem says that it is initially empty. . . Reflection: With the answer I chose, the output would be: word 1 = yarn, word 2 = zebra, and word 3 = xylophone. I knew that a temp would be needed and assigned to word 3, but the correct choice would have been choice b rather than c, since it produced the correct order of updated values. . . Reflection: When I saw the word “string,” I thought of the actual meaning, which is a word variable. However, this question was asking about a list index, which is the position of a list item. The position can’t be negative, contain a decimal, or be a word, so therefore the answer is 4. . . Reflection: The logic for this code segment is to first set the variable x to 0, and the variable result also to 0. Then, in a loop, variables x and result are added to set the new result value. At the end of the loop, 1 is added to x. This is done until the value of x is greater than 5. Loop iterations are outlined below: . 1st: x = 0, result = 0, new result = x + result = 0, new x = 1 . 2nd: x = 1, result = 0, new result = x + result = 1, new x = 2 . 3rd: x = 2, result = 1, new result = x + result = 3, new x = 3 . 4th: x = 3, result = 3, new result = x + result = 6, new x = 4 . 5th: x = 4, result = 6, new result = x + result = 10, new x = 5 ← this is where I stopped last time, so I incorrectly put the answer as 10 . 6th: x = 5, result = 10, new result = x + result = 15, new x = 6 ← answer is 15, since now x &gt; 5 . . Reflection: Although my calculations for the first 3 answer choices were correct, I didn’t employ PEMDAS for value d, which was c + d/2, while my first choice was to do (c + d)/2. . Unsure . . Reflection: I did not understand the logic for this question when I first read it, so this answer was guess and just happened to be correct. I consulted an industry professional to try and better understand the logic. The lists j and k should both be within the length of numList. The program’s documentation is what is provided to the user of the program to keep in mind before using it. The user should make sure j and k are within the parameters listed and should know the purpose, to interchange j and k. . *However, the indices should be starting at 0, not 1 . . Reflection: The inner loop always starts with one element after the outer loop ( k ← j+1). Hence, the comparison is always with the subsequent elements at each iteration. . All the binary questions . Reflection: I need practice with binary to decimal conversions, which I will watch youtube videos for and learn .",

            "content": "Lab 1: Measurements and Graphical Analysis . Purpose Statement: Given “disks” of different radii, determine the relationship between the mass and radius of the disks through graphical method. In using graphical method, we will learn about linearization and the use of it to create a mathematical model. . Outline of Procedure: . Foil disks of differing sizes are collected. . | The radius of each disk is measured in cm, and multiplied by itself to calculate r2. . | A disk is chosen at random, and folded in half 4 times. The thickness of the folded disk is measured, then divided by 16 to produce the actual thickness of the original disk (unfolded). Each disk has been cut from the same foil sheet, hence the thickness of disks are uniform. . | Each disk is weighed on a scale, and mass is recorded in a data table. . | What is the precision of the meterstick I used? Explain how you know this based on the data I provided. . The precision of the meterstick is to the tenth of a centimeter, in terms of measurement. When my group measured the actual disks, we went one significant figure beyond the shown measurement. . Data Table: . Cylinder Height (cm), Mass (g), and Calculated Radius2 (cm2) Values . . Graphs: . . m = 0.016r^2 - 0.036 . . m = 0.013r^2 + 0.024r - 0.090 . Analysis Questions: . What is the independent variable in your y = mx +b formula? . | The independent variable in our y = 0.016x - 0.036 is x, or radius2 (cm2). . What does the slope represent in your y = mx +b formula? Show dimensionally that indeed that is what your slope represents and that the formula is valid dimensionally. . | The slope is 0.016, which is grams / cm2. The slope is change in mass of cylinder over quantity of change in radius2. . . Should the “b” in your y = mx + b formula be zero? Explain your answer. . | No, the b should not be 0 due to data collection errors. In a perfect world, the line of best fit would go through the origin since if the radius is 0 cm, then radius2 is also 0 cm2, hence the mass would be 0 g. However, due to human error, the data values for radius and mass are not exact, hence the line of best fit that will best represent the data does not go through the origin. A line of best fit should represent all the data points best, not just the origin. . Measure/estimate the “thickness” of your cylinders. Use that value to find the experimental density of your cylinders. Find a percent difference between your found density and the actual density. The actual material is aluminum. . The estimated value for “thickness” is 0.00625 cm. The calculated value of density of the disk is 0.815 g/cm3 (calculations shown below). . | | . The calculated percent difference between actual density (2.7 g/cm3) and calculated density (0.815 g/cm3) is -93%. . | . errors. Make sure you explain why your number is bigger or smaller than (if positive or negative difference.) . Some of the aluminum disks had tiny holes or deficiencies, which likely means that mass measured is inaccurate. The thickness of each disk was extremely small, making it a difficult quantity to measure; hence, there are measurement inaccuracies present due to human error/ limitations. . | | Synthesis Questions: . In this experiment, if we had used disks with greater thickness, would the slope of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be the same? Explain. . If the disks had a greater thickness, then the slope of the best fit line would be different. A greater thickness of the cylinders would result in a higher mass, even if the radius was the same. Hence, the slope of the line of the graph r2, on the x-axis, and mass in g, on the y-axis, would be greater (calculated by taking change in mass over change in r2). . | However, the density would not change. Once the slope of the best fit line is found, it is plugged into the equation slope = (pi)(thickness or height of cylinder)(density). Density is then solved for; the procedure has been demonstrated on analysis question 4. Since the thickness value plugged into this equation is also increased (along with slope), the density value would not be affected. Theoretically, the density value would not change anyway because the material, aluminum, remains the same no matter the thickness of the disk. . | | How would your graph of m vs r2 be different if you had used disks of the same thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m vs r2 plot that represents disks made of steel. . A graph of m vs r2 for disks made out of steel would contain a steeper line of best fit, or one with a higher slope value, than one for disks made of aluminum. This is because disks made of aluminum have a lower density (2.7 g/cm3) than steel (7.85 g/cm3), and working backwards from the slope = (pi)(h of cylinder)(density) equation mentioned in above questions, increasing the density would increase the slope. Since only the density/ material of disks would change, each r2 value would remain the same, while mass would be higher for each steel disk. Hence, the estimated line of best fit for steel disks is steeper by about 7.85/ 2.7 times. . | | . Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; however, their . | disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to determine. The group’s m versus . r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had . the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the density of the unknown material and use the table . below to help determine what material their disks are made of. . The density of the unknown material is about 7.77 g/cm3. Therefore, the material of . | the disks is likely iron. . . Multiple Choice Questions: . . Question 3: The answer is c) r3. Since d = m/v and in this case the volume of spheres are . (4/3)(pi)(r3), the m is linearly proportional to r3. .",

Procedure: named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values . can also be referred as method or function, depending on the language | need to examine code line by line to determine this | . Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality .

What are some other names for procedures? . function | . Why are procedures effective? . they allow us to find out individually where something may have gone wrong | you can look at only the function or place where something went wrong, rather than the whole | .

            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 .

We would like you to input questions into a list, and use some sort of iterative system to print the questions, detect an input, and determine if you answered correctly. There should be at least five questions, each with at least three possible answers. . You may use the template below as a framework for this assignment. . questions = [ #questions go here (remember to make them strings!) &quot;1. In the for loop, for i in range(9), what is final value of i?&quot;, &quot;2. What does the list method pop do?&quot;, &quot;3. What does the and operator do?&quot;, &quot;4. When is the base used when converting binary to decimal?&quot;, &quot;5. What are loops that involve incrementing a variable till a breaking point?&quot; ] answerOptions = [ #Options to choose from for each question above (&quot;A. 10&quot;, &quot;B. 9&quot;, &quot;C. 8&quot;), (&quot;A. Add an element to the list&quot;, &quot;B. Replace an element in the list&quot;, &quot;C. Remove an element from the list&quot;), (&quot;A. Adds two values&quot;, &quot;B. Returns True if both values are same&quot;, &quot;C. Returns False if both values are same&quot;), (&quot;A. 2&quot;, &quot;B. 10&quot;, &quot;C. 8&quot;), (&quot;A. while&quot;, &quot;B. recursive&quot;, &quot;C. Binary&quot;) ] # the real answers answers = [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;] def questionloop(): score = 0 for i in range(len(questions) - 1): print(questions[i]) #print the question print(answerOptions[i]) #print the possible options ans = input(&#39;Choose answer from the options: &#39;) #get input from user if(answercheck(i, ans) == True): #pass the index of the question and the user&#39;s answer to our function print(&quot;Correct answer!&quot;) score += 1 #increment the score if answer is correct else: print(&quot;Wrong answer!&quot;) print(&quot;Your score: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(score) #print the final score #check the answer by comparing it with the answer stored in answers list def answercheck(index, answer): if (answers[index] == answer): return True else: return False #start our questionnaire questionloop() . 1. In the for loop, for i in range(9), what is final value of i? (&#39;A. 10&#39;, &#39;B. 9&#39;, &#39;C. 8&#39;) Correct answer! 2. What does the list method pop do? (&#39;A. Add an element to the list&#39;, &#39;B. Replace an element in the list&#39;, &#39;C. Remove an element from the list&#39;) Wrong answer! 3. What does the and operator do? (&#39;A. Adds two values&#39;, &#39;B. Returns True if both values are same&#39;, &#39;C. Returns False if both values are same&#39;) Wrong answer! 4. When is the base used when converting binary to decimal? (&#39;A. 2&#39;, &#39;B. 10&#39;, &#39;C. 8&#39;) Correct answer! Your score: 2 . Hacks . Here are some ideas of things you can do to make your program even cooler. Doing these will raise your grade if done correctly. . Add more than five questions with more than three answer choices | Randomize the order in which questions/answers are output | At the end, display the user&#39;s score and determine whether or not they passed | . Challenges . Important! You don&#39;t have to complete these challenges completely perfectly, but you will be marked down if you don&#39;t show evidence of at least having tried these challenges in the time we gave during the lesson. . 3.10 Challenge . Follow the instructions in the code comments. . grocery_list = [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;milk&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;] # Print the fourth item in the list print(grocery_list[3]) # Now, assign the fourth item in the list to a variable, x and then print the variable x = grocery_list[3] print(x) # Add these two items at the end of the list : umbrellas and artichokes grocery_list.append(&quot;umbrellas&quot;) grocery_list.append(&quot;artichokes&quot;) # Insert the item eggs as the third item of the list grocery_list.insert(2, &quot;eggs&quot;) # Remove milk from the list grocery_list.remove(&quot;milk&quot;) # or can use .pop # Assign the element at the end of the list to index 2.

Create a loop that converts 8-bit binary values from the provided list into decimal numbers. Then, after the value is determined, remove all the values greater than 100 from the list using a list-related function you&#39;ve been taught before. Print the new list when done. . Once you&#39;ve done this with one of the types of loops discussed in this lesson, create a function that does the same thing with a different type of loop. . binarylist = [ &quot;01001001&quot;, &quot;10101010&quot;, &quot;10010110&quot;, &quot;00110111&quot;, &quot;11101100&quot;, &quot;11010001&quot;, &quot;10000001&quot; ] print (&quot;Original List: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print (binarylist) #use this function to convert every binary value in binarylist to decimal #afterward, get rid of the values that are greater than 100 in decimal def binary_convert(binary): binLen = 8 # length of each 8-bit string is fixed to 8 dec = 0 # used to store our converted decimal value # we want to extract the bits from right to left for i in range(binLen): # replace with &quot;while i &lt; binLen&quot; if you want to use while loop dec += int(binary[binLen-i-1]) * 2**i #convert binary digit to decimal and add to our variable #uncomment if using the while loop version # i += 1 return dec #return the final converted value # Make a new list while iterating thru the original list # This new list will store only those values that are less than or equal 100 # In the end, replace the original list with this new list newBinaryList = [] for bin in binarylist: if (binary_convert(bin)) &lt;= 100: newBinaryList.append(bin) binarylist = newBinaryList #replace original list print(&quot;Final List: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(binarylist) #when done, print the results .

            "content": ". . Reflection: Although my logic was correct, I chose the answer choice with the wrong order of code. The actual answer involved appending the list first, which makes sense since the problem says that it is initially empty. . . Reflection: With the answer I chose, the output would be: word 1 = yarn, word 2 = zebra, and word 3 = xylophone. I knew that a temp would be needed and assigned to word 3, but the correct choice would have been choice b rather than c, since it produced the correct order of updated values. . . Reflection: When I saw the word “string,” I thought of the actual meaning, which is a word variable. However, this question was asking about a list index, which is the position of a list item. The position can’t be negative, contain a decimal, or be a word, so therefore the answer is 4. . . Reflection: The logic for this code segment is to first set the variable x to 0, and the variable result also to 0. Then, in a loop, variables x and result are added to set the new result value. At the end of the loop, 1 is added to x. This is done until the value of x is greater than 5. Loop iterations are outlined below: . 1st: x = 0, result = 0, new result = x + result = 0, new x = 1 . 2nd: x = 1, result = 0, new result = x + result = 1, new x = 2 . 3rd: x = 2, result = 1, new result = x + result = 3, new x = 3 . 4th: x = 3, result = 3, new result = x + result = 6, new x = 4 . 5th: x = 4, result = 6, new result = x + result = 10, new x = 5 ← this is where I stopped last time, so I incorrectly put the answer as 10 . 6th: x = 5, result = 10, new result = x + result = 15, new x = 6 ← answer is 15, since now x &gt; 5 . . Reflection: Although my calculations for the first 3 answer choices were correct, I didn’t employ PEMDAS for value d, which was c + d/2, while my first choice was to do (c + d)/2. . Unsure . . Reflection: I did not understand the logic for this question when I first read it, so this answer was guess and just happened to be correct. I consulted an industry professional to try and better understand the logic. The lists j and k should both be within the length of numList. The program’s documentation is what is provided to the user of the program to keep in mind before using it. The user should make sure j and k are within the parameters listed and should know the purpose, to interchange j and k. . *However, the indices should be starting at 0, not 1 . . Reflection: The inner loop always starts with one element after the outer loop ( k ← j+1). Hence, the comparison is always with the subsequent elements at each iteration. . All the binary questions . Reflection: I need practice with binary to decimal conversions, which I will watch youtube videos for and learn .",

            "content": "Lab 1: Measurements and Graphical Analysis . Purpose Statement: Given “disks” of different radii, determine the relationship between the mass and radius of the disks through graphical method. In using graphical method, we will learn about linearization and the use of it to create a mathematical model. . Outline of Procedure: . Foil disks of differing sizes are collected. . | The radius of each disk is measured in cm, and multiplied by itself to calculate r2. . | A disk is chosen at random, and folded in half 4 times. The thickness of the folded disk is measured, then divided by 16 to produce the actual thickness of the original disk (unfolded). Each disk has been cut from the same foil sheet, hence the thickness of disks are uniform. . | Each disk is weighed on a scale, and mass is recorded in a data table. . | What is the precision of the meterstick I used? Explain how you know this based on the data I provided. . The precision of the meterstick is to the tenth of a centimeter, in terms of measurement. When my group measured the actual disks, we went one significant figure beyond the shown measurement. . Data Table: . Cylinder Height (cm), Mass (g), and Calculated Radius2 (cm2) Values . . Graphs: . . m = 0.016r^2 - 0.036 . . m = 0.013r^2 + 0.024r - 0.090 . Analysis Questions: . What is the independent variable in your y = mx +b formula? . | The independent variable in our y = 0.016x - 0.036 is x, or radius2 (cm2). . What does the slope represent in your y = mx +b formula? Show dimensionally that indeed that is what your slope represents and that the formula is valid dimensionally. . | The slope is 0.016, which is grams / cm2. The slope is change in mass of cylinder over quantity of change in radius2. . . Should the “b” in your y = mx + b formula be zero? Explain your answer. . | No, the b should not be 0 due to data collection errors. In a perfect world, the line of best fit would go through the origin since if the radius is 0 cm, then radius2 is also 0 cm2, hence the mass would be 0 g. However, due to human error, the data values for radius and mass are not exact, hence the line of best fit that will best represent the data does not go through the origin. A line of best fit should represent all the data points best, not just the origin. . Measure/estimate the “thickness” of your cylinders. Use that value to find the experimental density of your cylinders. Find a percent difference between your found density and the actual density. The actual material is aluminum. . The estimated value for “thickness” is 0.00625 cm. The calculated value of density of the disk is 0.815 g/cm3 (calculations shown below). . | | . The calculated percent difference between actual density (2.7 g/cm3) and calculated density (0.815 g/cm3) is -93%. . | . errors. Make sure you explain why your number is bigger or smaller than (if positive or negative difference.) . Some of the aluminum disks had tiny holes or deficiencies, which likely means that mass measured is inaccurate. The thickness of each disk was extremely small, making it a difficult quantity to measure; hence, there are measurement inaccuracies present due to human error/ limitations. . | | Synthesis Questions: . In this experiment, if we had used disks with greater thickness, would the slope of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be the same? Explain. . If the disks had a greater thickness, then the slope of the best fit line would be different. A greater thickness of the cylinders would result in a higher mass, even if the radius was the same. Hence, the slope of the line of the graph r2, on the x-axis, and mass in g, on the y-axis, would be greater (calculated by taking change in mass over change in r2). . | However, the density would not change. Once the slope of the best fit line is found, it is plugged into the equation slope = (pi)(thickness or height of cylinder)(density). Density is then solved for; the procedure has been demonstrated on analysis question 4. Since the thickness value plugged into this equation is also increased (along with slope), the density value would not be affected. Theoretically, the density value would not change anyway because the material, aluminum, remains the same no matter the thickness of the disk. . | | How would your graph of m vs r2 be different if you had used disks of the same thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m vs r2 plot that represents disks made of steel. . A graph of m vs r2 for disks made out of steel would contain a steeper line of best fit, or one with a higher slope value, than one for disks made of aluminum. This is because disks made of aluminum have a lower density (2.7 g/cm3) than steel (7.85 g/cm3), and working backwards from the slope = (pi)(h of cylinder)(density) equation mentioned in above questions, increasing the density would increase the slope. Since only the density/ material of disks would change, each r2 value would remain the same, while mass would be higher for each steel disk. Hence, the estimated line of best fit for steel disks is steeper by about 7.85/ 2.7 times. . | | . Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; however, their . | disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to determine. The group’s m versus . r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had . the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the density of the unknown material and use the table . below to help determine what material their disks are made of. . The density of the unknown material is about 7.77 g/cm3. Therefore, the material of . | the disks is likely iron. . . Multiple Choice Questions: . . Question 3: The answer is c) r3. Since d = m/v and in this case the volume of spheres are . (4/3)(pi)(r3), the m is linearly proportional to r3. .",

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data.

You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend. JavaScript frontend code in APCSP fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-jokes.md | Backend Endpoints. Python code that allows Frontend access: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio/blob/main/api.py | Backend Jokes Management. Python code that support Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD): https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio/blob/main/model_jokes.py | . | . Hacks . Find and use an API as part of your project. An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .

Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding. FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests. | . | .",

            "content": "console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); // define msg as a variable first, or put message in quotes . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); // string message logIt(2022) // number . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf, classLevel) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.classLevel = classLevel; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role, classLevel: this.classLevel}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977, &quot;master&quot;); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, classLevel: &#39;master&#39;, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} .

Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string (John Doe is the output/ value and name is the key) # type(name) is an abreviation for string name = &quot;Jiya&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 17 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 95.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) # langs is an abreviation for language # 3 is the index in the list langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[3]&quot;, langs[3], type(langs[3])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name Jiya &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 17 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 95.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[3] Bash &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Jiya&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 17, &#39;score&#39;: 95.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] Jiya &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; .

As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure.

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Last snack eaten was&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Last_Snack&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Favorite drink:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Fav_Drink&quot;]) print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() # For loop to print InfoDB in reverse order print(&quot;For loop output in REVERSE ORDER for &quot; + str(len(InfoDb)) + &quot; items.&quot;) for record in reversed(InfoDb): print_data(record) .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Last snack eaten was Fruity Thing Favorite drink: Coffee Jiya Savlani Residence: San Diego Birth Day: March 7 Cars: Lambo Last snack eaten was Bar Favorite drink: Lemonade Shreya Sapkal Residence: San Diego Birth Day: December 12 Cars: 2013-Ford Escape, 2020-Chrysler Pacifica Last snack eaten was Chewy Thing Favorite drink: Water . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

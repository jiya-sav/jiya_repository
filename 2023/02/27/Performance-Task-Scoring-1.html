<p>Creative, Collaborative, and Quality Culture</p>

<p><strong>Express, “What would you code given absolute freedom?</strong></p>

<p>If given absolute freedom, I would want to code something related to helping students access books and learning resources free of charge. Although the legality of this type of code can be debated, I think it would be really cool to be able to create a platform where learning could be shared for the sake of learning and not an ulterior motive (usually profit). I think a platform like this would not only give me a purpose in coding, but would help others. Some technical aspects to the platform could include a voting feature where users could vote for the usefulness of resources, an api for organization purposes, and more.</p>

<p><strong>What would motivate you to be productive each day given the freedom to code what you want?</strong></p>

<p>Generally, when I am unmotivated to code it is because what I am doing does not have an application that is of interest to me. For example, the binary to decimal converter code assignments from the past few weeks were boring.</p>

<p><strong>How would you measure success in your team?</strong></p>

<p>In my opinion, success in my scrum team is based on how collaborative we are. I think that there is more value in learning together than constructing a complex piece of code by ourselves. Success is about building each other up and making sure we all understand basic concepts before moving on to produce amazing work. Even if the work produced is not super complicated, effective learning is what matters. I think that every person has a unique, valuable perspective that should be shared, so “success” in my scrum team to me means that everyone’s perspective is mixed.</p>

<p><strong>In a project, most students are more motivated if the project seems useful, unique, and has an interested consumer. How will you maintain motivation?</strong></p>

<p>I will do my best to maintain my motivation by adding a creative element to the projects I work on. If the work becomes redundant or too heavy on the back end, then I will try to take a break and develop the front end more. I think that although having back and front end code work properly are both satisfying, there is more immediate gratification in having the front end done, because it is more visibly working.</p>

<p>Ending Questions:</p>

<p><strong>Provide summary in comment on why information is this blog is important?</strong></p>

<p>This blog was a reminder on agile methodology and what we can do in our scrum roles to help our teams reach goals. The questions asked here also provided me insight into the benefits of coding and project based learning. I was reminded of what I should be doing while coding, and that I should be working properly with my team and doing my role, and at the same time staying motivated.</p>

<p><strong>Would you rather work on PBL project, or or do assigned free-response coding questions (aka FRQs)? Which would be easier to meet class standards?</strong></p>

<p>I would much rather work on a PBL project, since I would have more freedom to meet class standards and demonstrate my interpretation of the topics. PBL in my opinion also allows students to retain information better, because we can practice the concepts while displaying our creativity instead of just a set format/ rote memorization.</p>

<p><strong>Trust and Freedom are often earned. How will you show your passion and ability to succeed in your work?</strong></p>

<p>I hope to earn trust and freedom in the classroom by showing that I am capable of fulfilling the requirements and taking away the right learnings, while still maintaining independence and personality. I hope that my code will not only include the standards that college board and the teachers desire, but it will also demonstrate my passion and have fun elements.</p>

<p><strong>What key learnings and focusses are a priority for you?</strong></p>

<p>I hope to prioritize becoming proficient in javascript in particular. I think that javascript is a valuable language to know, because it is integral when working on the front end of any project. It doesn’t matter how nice the backend is- if your site doesn’t look professional, then no one will take your work seriously.</p>

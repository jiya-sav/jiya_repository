    "Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files.  Describe how these relate to Data Compression ...\n",
    "- File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab\n",
    "File type defines the compression format used to represent the images. It dictates how the pixels of the image itself are compressed.\n",
    "Metadata of bit depth (how many bits are used to describe each pixel), dimensions/ size, storage, and more attributes of each image can be seen through properties.\n",
    "JPEG is \"joint photgraphers experts group.\" PNG is \"portable network graphics.\" Both are compression formats used for represnting digital images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Size, height and width, number of pixels\n",
    "Pixels are the tiny subunits the makeup an image. Each pixel can have a certain depth or take up an amount of storage, which differs from image to image depending on resolution/definition.\n",
    "Pixels have colors which can be represented by 32 bits of RGB values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visual perception, lossy compression\n",
    "JPEGs are compressed using lossy compression, where highly detailed images with many colors are made into smaller files by permenantly deleting some information from the file. Every time an image is stored and edited, some data is lost.\n",
    "PNGs are compressed using lossless compression techniques, where no data is lost and quality remains the same no matter how many times you edit or save the image. This is why PNG file sizes are bigger comapared to JPEG.\n",
    "Fun fact: JPEGs don't support images with transparent backgorunds, but PNGs do."

    "- What are commands you use in terminal to access files? What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files?\n",
    "To change to a specific file or folder path in the powershell, you would use cd ~generaldirectory/specificlocation. To open a file, you can also type the name of the program you want to open with and filename. Example: Notepad txt\n",
    "You can use the dir command to list contents of a folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are some of the major differences?\n",
    "In Windows, files are stored using a directories and folders organizational system, while in Linux there is a tree/ branches system. Using a Windows storage system means more options for compatibility, but Linux systems are more secure and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code.\n",
    "- Why is path a big deal when working with images?\n",
    "Paths provide the exact location of the file, which is very imporatant when accessing them. In this case, if the path is not accurate, then the image will not be properly accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics?\n",
    "Meta data source tells us the source and data of the file, like device used to take photo and who took it. This relates to computing inequity, because not everyone will have the same access to more expensive and better-quality devices. For example, someone from a lower socioeconomic class who can't afford more storage will likely use the jpeg format rather than png, but will lose data by doing so and therefore be at a disadvantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images?\n",
    "Pandas are libraries used when working with data sets. They help to clean, organize, sort, and manipulate data. \n",
    "Ipython is a python interpreter. It is useful in a Jupyter notebook as a kernel for code to be viewed and read in.\n",
    "You can use pandas to describe types of operation and image manipulation in IPython. The interactive nature of IPython makes it interesting to describe images in jupyter notebooks."

    "> Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations.  In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer.  In this example, there is a very large picture that lags.\n",
    "- Where have you been a consumer of buffering?  \n",
    "On streaming platforms like Youtube and Netflix, if there is a delay in internet connection. In my experience, the video is paused during this lag, and the audio still plays. Even if the internet goes away, sometimes the video still plays for a few seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering?  \n",
    "When I have seen delays in the start of the content, the frames of the screen keep on moving even after a connection issue occurs, which was nnoying.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do these effects apply to images?\n",
    "When loading images, as buffering is happening, an incomplete picture with few pixels displays, but as the image loads, the image becomes more clear and all the proper pixels show up."

    "\n",
    "- Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed?\n",
    "Yes; each function has a series of steps. The program first builds an image library, scales it to 320 width, then converts each image to HTML, then to gray scale HTML.\n",

    "- Describe scale image?  What is before and after on pixels in three images?\n",
    "To scale the image, the width of each is changed, percentage wise, to 320 pixels. The height is also changed to maintain the aspect ratio and not distort the image. \n",

    "- Is scale image a type of compression?  If so, line it up with College Board terms described?\n",
    "Yes; if the image width is greater than 320 pixels before it is scaled, it must be compressed and hence loses pixels. This is a type of lossy compression, since overall the image loses data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges: There is no optimization when scaling the image up. In the scaling function, if an image is too smaller (less than the 320 pixels stated), then it will appear pixelated and not so clear once the size is increased."

### Reflection: Algorithm A also produces the right answer. At first, I thought it didn't because I interpreted steps 2 and 3 as duplicating the heights. However, the actual function of the algorithm is to replace the previous sum value with the new sum value, adding every height once and not duplicating it.

## Question 30

### Reflection: Answer choice B should be chosen rather than A, because the variables x, y, and z must be recognized before the actual actions occur involving the variables.

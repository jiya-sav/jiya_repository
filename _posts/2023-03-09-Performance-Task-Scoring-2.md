| Program purpose and function | 1        | 1            | The video clearly demonstrates the program purpose, to create a poem with user inputs.                                                                                           |
| Data abstraction             | 1        | 1            | Two code segments provided, with data shown to be stored in wordList, selectWord, and nounList. Parameters are clearly being utilized, and nouns are stored in list.             |
| Managing complexity          | 1        | 1            | They explain how their list that stores the nouns is integral to the organization of their poem generation. Without this method of storage, their program would be much messier. |
| Procedural abstraction       | 1        | 1            | Procedure createpoems clearly explained, and connected back to main purpose of program.                                                                                          |
| Algorithm implementation     | 1        | 1            | The calls are clearly identified and described in createpoems procedure. Poem building incorporating if statements and iteration is described.                                   |
| Testing                      | 1        | 1            | The results of the calls are successful; poems are outputted. Specific calls articlePoem and noArticlePoem are included, and poem output is used to test procedure.              |

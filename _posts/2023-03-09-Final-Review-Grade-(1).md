Personal Achievements

Debugging and finding/ fixing errors on aws: While connecting frontend to backend, I had many issues with fetching the aws link. I learned that before committing a change on our flask server, my teammates and I should run the command docker-compose up --build, so we can find and fix errors before crashing our entire deployed site. I also made use of the inspect feature on my browser when finding issues with my frontend, specifically formatting and when the table of recipes was not displaying correctly. I found that adding alerts throughout each step was a great way to see where errors occurred, so I could pinpoint the exact problem within my code.

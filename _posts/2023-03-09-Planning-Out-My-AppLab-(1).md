Plan for quiz:

1.  > Home screen will contain 2 choices; one is for a quiz and the other is a drawing game

<!-- end list -->

  - > Blue Quiz

  - > Red Quiz

Score: variable score created

2.  > Blue Quiz: 2 vacation paths; only right way is valid and left way doesn’t work

3.  > Mexico path takes to first question: Which flag is Mexico’s flag?
    
    1.  > If wrong options are clicked, then taken to a screen showing answer
    
    2.  > If correct answer is chosen, then taken to a screen saying “correct,” and 1 point is added to variable score
    
    3.  > Button taking to next question is present, on both result screens

4.  > Question 2: What is the capital of Mexico?
    
    1.  > If wrong options are clicked, then taken to a screen showing answer
    
    2.  > If correct answer is chosen, then taken to a screen saying “correct,” and 1 point is added to variable score
    
    3.  > Button taking to next question is present, on both result screens

5.  > Question 3: What year was the Mexican revolution? (1910)
    
    1.  > If wrong options are clicked, then taken to a screen showing answer
    
    2.  > If correct answer is chosen, then taken to a screen saying “correct,” and 1 point is added to variable score
    
    3.  > Button taking to next question is present, on both result screens

6.  > Final screen shows score out of 3

<!-- end list -->

1.  
2.  > Red Quiz: exploring with neo and trinity

3.  > Taken to a page with drawing game:
    
    1.  > Set 2 sliders; one for y and one for x position
    
    2.  > Use get command to show turtle where sliders are, based on what user puts x and y as
    
    3.  > Change pen color based on button clicked
    
    4.  > Ask for pen size in a prompt
